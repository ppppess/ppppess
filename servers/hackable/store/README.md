# Hackable Store

**The storage part of the [PPPP][pppp] ecosystem.**

We call it **the sky** (not "the cloud" :smile:) but it is in essence **your own private cloud**.




## Installation

* Make sure you have included "store" in the services options when 
[starting the server](https://github.com/ppppess/ppppess/blob/master/servers/hackable/README.md#options)


#### Development


#### Production

* Enter your account number in the 
[pricing.json]() 
if you want to get paid when people access the stored files


## API

The server only accepts X types of request:

* read

* write

* keep




## Hackers please help !

We can use any help (testing, translating, auditing, redesiging, whatever you might think about)

Fork the project, hack it, test it.

If you find any security issue,  
[please file a security bug](https://github.com/ppppess/ppppess/issues)
