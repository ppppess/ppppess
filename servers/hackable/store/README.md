# Store

**The storage part of the [PPPP][pppp] ecosystem.**

We call it **the sky** (not "the cloud":smile:) but it is in essence **your own private cloud**.

it is hackable: just use this code as inspiration, and make a much better storage server!


## Installation

* Make sure you have included "store" in the 
[services options](https://github.com/ppppess/ppppess/blob/master/servers/hackable/README.md#options)
when 
[starting the server](https://github.com/ppppess/ppppess/blob/master/servers/hackable/README.md#usage)

#### Development


#### Production

* Enter your account number in the 
[config.pricing.json](https://github.com/ppppess/ppppess/blob/master/servers/hackable/store/config.pricing.json)
if you want to get paid when users store or access their files


## API

The server only accepts X types of request:

* read

* write

* keep




## Hackers please help !

We can use any help (testing, translating, auditing, redesiging, whatever you might think about)

Fork the project, hack it, test it.
